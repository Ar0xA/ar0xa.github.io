  Hey there! You are curious about me? Shame on you.
</p>
<h1>Who are you?</h1>
Just a random, sarcastic, grumpy, foul-mouthed nobody who thinks he knows a thing or two about security. A gamer, a dad, a smart-ass, a book lover and anime freak. <br />
<br />
I'm also short tempered and have little patience for information security <a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/" target="_blank">charlatans</a>.
<p>
<h1>What do you do for a living?</h1>
So glad you asked! This is what I do:

<h1>You are amazing and I want to contact you!</h1>
Really? You might want to reconsider that. <br />

If you absolutely want to set yourself up for some kind of sarcastic abuse, you can contact me in the following ways:<br/>

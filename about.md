  Hey there! You are curious about me? Shame on you.
</p>
<h1>Who are you?</h1>
Just a random, sarcastic, grumpy, foul-mouthed nobody who thinks he knows a thing or two about security. A gamer, a dad, a smart-ass, a book lover and anime freak. <br />
<br />
I'm also short tempered and have little patience for information security <a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/" target="_blank">charlatans</a>.
<p>
<h1>What do you do for a living?</h1>
So glad you asked! This is what I do: <br /><br />

<h1>FAQ:</h1>
Q: Can I contact you for a job offering? <br />
A: Unless the offer includes a Bentley with chauffeur and all-you-can-eat Friday sushi: <u><b>absolutely not</b></u>!<br />
<br />
Q: Are you really so rude and sarcastic? <br />
A: No, but I need a place to vent. This is it. Deal with it. <br />
<br />
Q: Why no Disqus or something to allow comments? <br />
A: If you have questions, disagree or agree with something I wrote here enough to contact me, use twitter or email (see below).<br />

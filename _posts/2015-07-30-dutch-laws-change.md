title: Dutch law and responsible disclosure
description: Some thoughts about the responsible disclosure policies and the changes in Dutch law
---

In 2013 the Dutch government published an "Advice for responsible disclosure" (source: (Dutch) <a href="http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/cybercrime/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/01/04/leidraad-om-te-komen-tot-een-praktijk-van-responsible-disclosure.html" target="_blank">leidraad responsible disclosure</a>). The idea is that if whoever finds a bug adheres to the rules of the responsible disclosure policy of whatever entity he is looking at, he or she will not prosecuted by the entity compromised.
